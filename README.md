# nttnoperations
This is a special project which I developed to create my own python package.\
The package is just about 4 basic operations in math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.\
More infomation at: https://pypi.org/project/nttnoperations/0.0.2/ \

How to use?\
Step 1: Run "pip install nttnoperations==0.0.2"\
Step 2: Create a python file and try to "import nttnoperations"\

Note: There are 4 operations supported:\
+ addition: add_numbers(number1, number2)\
+ subtraction: subtract_numbers(number1, number2)\
+ multiplication: multiply_numbers(number1, number2)\
+ division: devide_numbers(number1, number2)\
